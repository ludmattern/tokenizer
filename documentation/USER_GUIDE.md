### Administrative Functions

```javascript
// Only owner can mint, respects max supply
await token.mint(recipientAddress, amount);
```

// Stop all transfers temporarily
await token.pause();

// Resume normal operations
await token.unpause();
```

#### Ownership Transfer

```javascript
// Transfer to MultiSig for enhanced security
await token.transferOwnership(multisigAddress);
```

## For MultiSig Operators

### MultiSig Wallet Usage

#### Understanding the System

- Requires multiple signatures for execution
- Default: 2 out of 3 owners must approve
- All transactions are visible on-chain
- Owners can revoke approval before execution

### MultiSig Operations

#### 1. Submit Transaction

```javascript
// Propose new transaction
await multisig.submitTransaction(
    targetAddress,
    ethValue,
    encodedData
);
```

#### 2. Confirm Transaction

```javascript
// Approve pending transaction
await multisig.confirmTransaction(transactionIndex);
```

#### 3. Execute Transaction

```javascript
// Execute after enough confirmations
await multisig.executeTransaction(transactionIndex);
```

#### 4. Revoke Confirmation

```javascript
// Withdraw approval before execution
await multisig.revokeConfirmation(transactionIndex);
```

### Common MultiSig Scenarios

#### Mint Tokens via MultiSig

1. Owner submits mint transaction
2. Other owners review and confirm
3. Execute after required confirmations
4. Tokens minted to target address

#### Emergency Pause via MultiSig

1. Owner submits pause transaction
2. Quick confirmation from other owners
3. Execute to pause all transfers
4. Investigate issue and unpause when safe
